## Hi there, I'm Pipo! 👋
### About Me
Born and raised in Vienna, with an affinity for tech from a very early age on. 

With a background in economics, I most recently worked as a policy officer on matters regarding social housing and the platform economy, with the latter leading me to switch into tech completely.
### I am currently... 
- 👨‍🎓 a student at the the Upleveled.io Web Development Bootcamp
- 🔭 working on a full stack web application as my final project
- 🌱 learning JavaScript, TypeScript, next.js, React.js, Node.js, PostgresQL, Emotion, Jest, Playwright
